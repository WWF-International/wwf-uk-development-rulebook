# GIT Rules

[GIT](https://git-scm.com/) is our version control system of choice.

When creating a branch on any project please follow these rules:

- If you are experimenting with a throw away branch please prefix the name with `DELETE_`
- Any other branch meant for work to be merged, please use the following naming convention: **YYYYMMDD_YOURINITIALS_BRANCHNAME** i.e **20171010_KF_addnewfeature**
- Please delete any branches that have no had any activity on them for **3 months**, this helps us keep a tidy workspace.
