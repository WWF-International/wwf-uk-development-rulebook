# PHP Rules

Many of WWF UK's projects are developed with PHP, including the main website.

For **all** PHP projects you must use the [Drupal Coding Standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/coding-standards), even if you project is not using Drupal.

### Ensuring You Are Adhere to the PHP Coding Standards

 - PHPStorm: File > Settings > Code Style > PHP > Set From > Predefined > Drupal
 - Sublime Text: [Official Setup Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/configuring-sublime-text)
 - Atom: [Plugin](https://atom.io/packages/linter-drupalcs)

You can also set up [CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) to integrate linting into your git workflow.
